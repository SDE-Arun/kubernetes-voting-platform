** we need to make sure that labels used in selector of RS should be same as the labels used in the pod template of the RS. **

==> If we create a pod apart from our RS {which is in running state} and this have same label as the RS, then this Pod will already will be in terminating state ...
... because RS will try to maintain the number of replicas and it will create a new pod with the same label as the RS and it will terminate the old pod.


kubectl edit rs replicaset_name_file.yaml  -->
-----------------------------------------
This will open the replicaset in the default editor and you can edit the fields like increasing the replicas, changing the image etc.


kubectl scale replicaset replicaset_name_file.yaml --replicas=5  --> 
---------------------------------------------------------------
This will scale the replicaset to 5 replicas from the current number of replicas with the help of terminal.
