# Kubernetes Voting Platform 🚀

Welcome to the **Kubernetes Voting Platform**! 🎉 This project demonstrates a simple, scalable voting application deployed using Kubernetes. It’s designed to showcase the power of **Kubernetes** for container orchestration and **microservices architecture**.

## Overview 🔍

This project uses **Kubernetes** to deploy a voting app, consisting of multiple components that include:

- **Frontend**: The user interface for casting votes.
- **Backend**: The service that processes votes and stores the data.
- **Worker**: A service that handles the vote counting.

The app is made up of several containerized components, deployed as **Pods** and exposed as **Services** using YAML files.

---

## Features 💡

- **Scalability**: Easily scale each component independently.
- **Containerization**: All components are containerized using Docker images.
- **High Availability**: Kubernetes ensures your app runs smoothly with multiple replicas of each service.
- **Easy Deployment**: Simply apply the YAML configuration files to deploy the app on any Kubernetes cluster.

---

## Project Structure 📁

- `pod.yaml`: Defines the Pods for the frontend, backend, and worker.
- `service.yaml`: Exposes the frontend and backend components as Kubernetes Services.

---

## Setup and Deployment 📦

### Prerequisites ⚙️

- A running **Kubernetes cluster** (local or cloud-based).
- **kubectl** configured to interact with your cluster.
- **Minikube** (for local Kubernetes setup) or any cloud Kubernetes service (e.g., GKE, EKS, AKS).

### Steps to Deploy 🚀

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SDE-Arun/kubernetes-voting-platform.git
   cd kubernetes-voting-platform
   ```

2. **Apply the Pod and Service YAML files**:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
   kubectl apply -f service.yaml
   ```

3. **Check the status of your pods**:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```

4. **Access the Voting App**:  
   You can access the app through the frontend service in your cluster. Use the following command to get the service URL:
   ```bash
   kubectl get svc
   ```

## Kubernetes Architecture 🏗️

This project is based on the following **Kubernetes components**:

- **Pods**: The basic deployable units that contain your containers.
- **Services**: Exposes the app’s frontend and backend to the outside world, allowing for load balancing and stable access.
